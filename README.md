# Impartial Selection Testing

This is a directory/project for implementing and testing the various impartial selection mechanisms.

This is also kind of a test for Nick to see if he can make a project that is "Open Sourceable" if someone wants to use any of the mechanisms.

# Dependencies

-The base setup requires Python 3.3+, PyTest, NumPy.

-The Notebooks require IPython and the full SciPy Stack (MatPlotLib, Pandas, etc.)

# TODO

1. Implement and write tests for:
	- Mallows Models Generation
	- Vanilla
	- Partition
	- DollarPartition
	- RandomDictator
	- Crediable Subset
